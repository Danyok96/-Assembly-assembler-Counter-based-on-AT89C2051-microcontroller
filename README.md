# -Assembly-assembler-Counter-based-on-AT89C2051-microcontroller

Counter code was written and simulated in Proteus 8 Profesional.

In this article I try to explain how to solve some problems and show you how calculate counter for your logic function.

"How to create logic function.docx" - Can help you create logic function and take it shorter.

"Information about logic function.docx" - Tells about circuit assembling and some information about logic function.

"With logical function.asm" - Code on assembly which tells how to realize counter on logic function on AT89C2051. Program use delay to print next result.

"Without logical function.asm" - Code on assembly which tells how to realize counter without logic function, use only saved sequence. Program use button to print next result.

"Counter(AT89C2051).pdsprj" - It Proteus 8 Profesional file with assembled circuit. You can test your code on it.

I trust it'll help for you. If you have a question write it on necron-x@mail.ru and I'll try help you.

Good luck!=)
